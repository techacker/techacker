- 👋 Hi, I’m Anurag Bansal a.k.a.@techacker
- 👀 I’m a firm believer of automation. Let computers do repetitive tasks that they are designed to do so that we can focus on other important activities.
- 🌱 As Steve Jobs once said, "Stay hungry, stay foolish" - Relenless learning and improving everyday is my goal.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with like-minded people and always excited to create something cool.
