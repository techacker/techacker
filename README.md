- 👋 Hi, I’m Anurag Bansal a.k.a.@techacker
- 👀 I’m a firm believer of automation. I love to automate things so that computers do the repetitive things while us humans can focus on better, more interesting things.
- 🌱 As Steve Jobs once said, "Stay hungry, stay foolish" - I am hungry for learning new things and always keeping my eyes and ears open for opportunities.
- 🌱 I'm currently working with a large team to start using a PLM system that I created based on Google Scipts (JavaScript). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with like-minded people and always excited to create something cool.
- 📫 How to reach me ... 
      Best way to reach me is on Twitter @techacker.
