- 👋 Hi, I’m Anurag Bansal a.k.a.@techacker
- 👀 I’m a firm believer of automation. Automate monotonous non-value-added activities so that computers can do what they are meant to do while we focus on more valuable tasks.
- 🌱 As Steve Jobs once said, "Stay hungry, stay foolish" - I am hungry for learning new things and always keeping my eyes and ears open for opportunities.
- 🌱 I'm currently guiding and helping a team to migrate their Engineering Lifecycle Management (PLM) system from Desktop to cloud using Google Script API and JavaScript. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with like-minded people and always excited to create something cool.
- 📫 How to reach me ... 
      Best way to reach me is on Twitter @techacker.
